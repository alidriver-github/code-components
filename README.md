# Plasmic code components demo

See the published site at https://code-components.plasmic.site.

See the Plasmic project at https://plasmic.app/proj/code-components.

This repo is a Next.js codebase bootstrapped with [`create-plasmic-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-plasmic-app). It serves as the application host for the Plasmic project.

## Getting started

Make sure you are logged in to Plasmic Studio: https://studio.plasmic.app.

1. Duplicate the above Plasmic project.
1. From your project dashboard at https://studio.plasmic.app, configure the duplicated project to use http://localhost:3000/host as the application host.
1. Start the dev server: `yarn dev`.
1. Open the duplicated Plasmic project.

Try registering new components or changing the props on components - you can drag/drop and configure them in Plasmic Studio!
